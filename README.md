# Hi there 👋 I am "J"

🌎 Well, let's see if I can spin together a short overview of me-self! 🌎
But bear with me... i'm still trying to get the hang of github und how all this syntax & markup works... 😅 


### - 🔭 I’m currently working on:... too many things at once 🤪
        
      - from Programming in General
       - learning CNC machining
        - CAD "designing"
         - renovating the basement of the house I live in
          - 3D printing
           - fixing my old VW Bus
            - Laser cutting
             - myself
              - and so on, and so on, ....
   

### - 🌱 On a more professional level, I am currently studying IT in Heidelberg (Germany)
concentrating on:
                        
                  - WEB
                   - Java
                    - Databases/SQL
                     - how to stay afloat in a life filled with overwhelming input 🧜‍♂️


### - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that involves fun
such as:
                                
                        - structures
                         - defining goals
                          - the "how to" kind of Thinking (rather than the "what")
                           - 🤔 IT-wise I'm looking for help understanding the world of Programming and writing code from an extremely basic level view...



### -  ❤️‍🔥 I love Knowledge... but in the *olde* sense of the word
("Knowledge" = KNOWING Things) <> ("Knowledge" = knowing ABOUT things)

                                    - starting with Conscious_interest in any *Variable*
                                     - covering Motivation,
                                      - Coping,
                                       - Communication                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...and if you have actually scrolled this far...              just because you saw the bar below and wondered why relativity seemed so odd;  We are probably pretty similar where our chraracters are concerned...
                                        - culminating in the *how to* of Manifesting or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I'd wager you are someone who is actually *interested* in the world - and what it is about...
                                         - Bringing_ideas_&_thoughts_into_Reality...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Someone who is *interested* in the things behind the OBVIOUS and "Easy to grasp"... And you are not afraid to expend YOUR energy, in order to find out what lies beyond... even if it is trivial, such as this text :)                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The joy of discovery, the conscious mind with an interest -or maybe even a thirst- for this knowledge of what I call the "old kind"...where the "why" and "how" are more important than the "what"...                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I am glad people like YOU still exist...🥰 In this world we seem to get fewer and fewer, or maybe we have learned not to show ourselves as openly, or maybe I just don't recognize a "kindred spirit" anymore... 🤷
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Whichever it might be... I'm glad you are here and I wish you a wonderful day/night!!! Feel free to drop me line... its always good to hear from someone CONSCIOUS! 🥰
